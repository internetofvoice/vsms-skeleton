# Voice Skill Management System (Skeleton)

> A framework aiming at the rapid development of custom skills for voice assistants.

## Introduction
VSMS is a skill development framework for voice assistants such as Amazon Voice Service. The intention is to speed up 
skill development by incorporating boilerplate code into a framework. VSMS is preconfigured to run multiple skills as 
well as serving HTML content. It can handle internationalisation and supports multiple server environments.

VSMS is written in PHP and comes with Slim application framework, Twig template engine, Analog logger and PHPUnit
(see "Libraries" section for more), but you are free to choose dependencies and a project structure as you see fit. 

## Requirements

* SSL-enabled web server 
* [composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

```
### Controller
This is where your Controllers, both skill and HTML controllers, reside. Controller methods are called based on 
intent invocations (skill controllers) or routing configuration (HTML controllers). Have a look at the provided 
examples for a kick start.  

### Services
Services provide backend functionality, like interactions with third party APIs that your skill can query data from.

### Templates
Templates help you to produce HTML output which is needed for Amazon's account linking feature, displaying a privacy
policy page or some neat marketing web pages.

### Translation
If you need multiple language support, place your translations here.

### Tests
Unit tests are preconfigured to work with PHPUnit. Examples are included, so you can throw in your own tests quickly.

### Var
Variable data, like log files or rendered template files, go in here.

### Assets 
Place your frontend files (CSS, JavaScript, images, ...) here as this directory is web-accessible â€“ in contrary to 
the `/app` directory, to which direct access is forbidden. You'll find a copy of the
[Bootstrap Library](http://getbootstrap.com/) here, which is used to generate a responsive login page for
Amazon's account linking feature.  

## Setup
### Server
- Setup an SSL-enabled web server / virtual host with PHP (5.6.0 or newer)
- A secure tunneling service like https://ngrok.com might be useful to expose your machine to an HTTPS accessible URL
- Install VSMS as described in the "Installation" section above 

### Environments
VSMS supports multiple environments like *dev*, *test*, *stage* and *prod* with the latter being the default. If you
want to use this feature, put an environment variable `APP_ENV` in your web server's virtual host configuration
and in your shell as test requests will not involve the web server.

Apache example:
```apacheconf   
<VirtualHost *:80>
 ServerName  my-skills.example.com
 (...)
 SetEnv      APP_ENV dev
</VirtualHost>
```
.bashrc example:
```bash 
export APP_ENV="dev"
```

When doing so, you may set environment dependent configurations in `/app/config/settings.php` and Skill IDs in your
skill controller(s). If you do not want to use this feature, set your configurations for the default *prod*.

Environments enable you for instance to skip request certificate validation (see `/app/config/settings.php`) 
and thus to send test / fake requests to your app. Please do *not* disable the validation in your production version, 
as it is mandatory - please see 
[Alexa Skills Kit Documentation](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/developing-an-alexa-skill-as-a-web-service#verifying-that-the-request-was-sent-by-alexa).


## Example content
VSMS comes with an example skill, a privacy policy page and a login form for account linking. While HTML pages can be 
examined with a browser, skills require a specific constructed request that you can fake with a tool like 
[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) (also available as a Chrome extension). Another option is to use the Service
Simulator you will find on https://developer.amazon.com/ when setting up your skill. 

The pre-configured URIs are:
- Skill: http(s)://your-hostname/example/skill
- Privacy policy: http(s)://your-hostname/example/privacy
- Account linking login form: http(s)://your-hostname/example/link

### Sending skill requests using Postman
Please find an example collection for Postman in `/app/test/Fixtures/Example.postman_collection.json`, import it 
to Postman and tweak it to your needs - at least the request url and applicationId need to match your setup.

### Running tests
Composer.json is preconfigured with some scripts to invoke PHPUnit tests:
```bash
$ cd /app 
$ composer test 
```
 
## Setup a skill with Amazon
- Login to https://developer.amazon.com
- Go to Alexa > Alexa Skills Kit https://developer.amazon.com/edw/home.html#/skills
- Add a new skill 
- Fill in the requested fields
- Copy the application ID and paste it into your skill controller, test fixtures and fake requests 
- Make your skill accessible via HTTPS by uploading it to a server or using a service like ngrok
- Put your skill URL (see `/app/config/routing.php`) into the skill configuration at Alexa Skills Kit   
- Test your skill with the Service Simulator provided by Amazon, with an Echo device or the Reverb app

If something goes wrong, check Amazons Service Simulator and the application log.

### Submit a skill for certification
Please test your skill thoroughly and step through
[Amazon's Certification Requirements](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/alexa-skills-kit-submission-checklist)
carefully to ensure the best experience for your end users and to improve the chance to get your skill certified.

**Please do not submit the example skill for certification.**   

## What's next?
VSMS aims to interact with multiple voice assistant systems, so it's not only nailed down to Alexa Skills Kit. 
With more services popping up, VSMS will be extended to support those too. The idea is to have a single environment 
to handle all your voice assistant development needs without writing duplicate code.
