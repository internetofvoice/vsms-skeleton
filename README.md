# Voice Skill Management System (Skeleton)

> A framework aiming at the rapid development of custom skills for voice assistants.

## Introduction
VSMS is a skill development framework for voice assistants such as Amazon Voice Service. The intention is to speed up 
skill development by incorporating boilerplate code into a framework. VSMS is preconfigured to run multiple skills as 
well as serving HTML content. It can handle internationalisation and supports multiple environments (by means of
dev, test, stage and prod). 

VSMS is written in PHP and comes with Slim application framework, Twig template engine, Analog logger und PHPUnit  
(see "Libraries" section), but you are free to choose dependencies and a project structure as you see fit. 

## Requirements
* PHP (at least 5.6.0)
* SSL-enabled web server 
* [composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)

    - [iOS App](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/amazon-echo/id944011620)
    - [Web based](https://alexa.amazon.com/spa/)
* Alexa-enabled device options:

```
### Controller
This is where your Controllers, both skill and HTML controllers, reside. Controller methods are called based on 
intent invocations (skill controllers) or routing configuration (HTML controllers). Have a look at the provided 
examples for a kick start.  

### Services
Services provide backend functionality, like interactions with third party APIs that your skill can query data from.

### Templates
Templates help you to produce HTML output which might be needed for Amazon's account linking feature, 
displaying your privacy policy page or some neat marketing web pages.

### Translation
If you need multiple language support four your skill or your HTML pages, place your translations here.

### Tests
Unit tests are preconfigured to work with PHPUnit. Example tests are included, so you can throw in your own tests quickly.

### Variable files
Log files, rendered template files and other variable data goes here.

### Assets 
Place your frontend files (CSS, JavaScript, images, ...) here as this directory is web-accessible â€“ in contrary to 
the `app/` directory, which is forbidden. You may need this for styling HTML output. You'll find a copy of 
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) here, which is used to generate a neat login page for Amazon's account
linking feature.  

## Setup
### Server
- Setup an SSL-enabled web server / virtual host with PHP (5.6.0 or newer)
- A secure tunneling service like https://ngrok.com might be useful to expose your machine to an HTTPS accessible URL.
- Install VSMS as described in the "Installation" section above 

### Environments
VSMS supports multiple environments like `dev`, `test`, `stage` and `prod` with the latter being the default. If you
want to use this feature, put the environment variable `APP_ENV` in your web server's virtual host configuration
(Apache example):
```apacheconf   
<VirtualHost *:80>
 ServerName  my-skills.example.com
 SetEnv      APP_ENV dev
 (...)
</VirtualHost>
```
*and*, for using PHPUnit tests, in your shell as tests will not use your web server. For example in `~/.bashrc` do:
```bash 
export APP_ENV="dev"
```

When doing so, you may set different configurations in `app/config/settings.php` and separate Skill IDs in your
skill controller(s) for every environment. When an environment is not set, it defaults to `prod`.

Using environments enables you for instance to skip request certificate validation (see `app/config/settings.php`) 
and thus to send fake requests to your app. Please do not disable the validation in your production version, as it is 
is mandatory per Amazons requirements - please see 
[Alexa Skills Kit Documentation](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/developing-an-alexa-skill-as-a-web-service#verifying-that-the-request-was-sent-by-alexa).


## Example content
VSMS comes with an example skill, a privacy policy page and a login form for account linking. HTML pages can be 
examined with a browser, whereas skills require a specific constructed request that you can fake with a tool like 
[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) (also available as a Chrome extension). Another option is to use the Service
Simulator you will find on https://developer.amazon.com/ when setting up your skill. 

The pre-configured URIs are:
- Skill: http(s)://your-hostname/example/skill
- Privacy policy: http(s)://your-hostname/example/privacy
- Account linking login form: http(s)://your-hostname/example/link

### Faking a skill request with Postman
Please find an example collection for Postman in `/app/test/Fixtures/Example.postman_collection.json`, import it 
to Postman and tweak it to your needs - at least change request url and applicationId in the request body to
match your environment.   

### Running tests
```bash
$ cd /app 
$ composer test 
```
 
## Connecting the example skill with Amazon
- Create an account at or login to https://developer.amazon.com
- Go to Alexa > Alexa Skills Kit https://developer.amazon.com/edw/home.html#/skills
- Add a new skill 
- Fill in the requested fields
- Copy your application ID (amzn1.ask.skill.xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx) and put it into your skill 
controller (and fake requests, ...) 
- Make your skill accessible via HTTPS by uploading it to a server or using a service like ngrok
- Put the resulting skill URL into the skill configuration at Alexa Skills Kit   
- Test your skill with the Service Simulator provided by Amazon 
- Test your skill with an Echo device or the Reverb app to hear Alexa finally talking!  

### Submitting a skill for certification
Please test your skill thoroughly and carefully read the 
[Amazons Certification Requirements](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/alexa-skills-kit-submission-checklist)
to ensure the best experience for your skill's end users. 

**Please do not submit the example skill for certification!**   

## What's next?
VSMS aims to interact with multiple voice assistant systems, so it's not only nailed down to Amazon Voice Service. 
With more services popping up, VSMS will be extended to support those too. The idea is to have a single environment 
to handle all your voice assistant development needs without writing duplicate code.
